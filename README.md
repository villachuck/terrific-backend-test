Welcome to the Backend of the Terrific's To-Do List App challenge.

I took the liberty to deploy the App using Vercel. For the database I used Supabase, and the free plan allow me to have 2 users. One was mine for my own test, so I will share the credentials of the second user:

link: http://frontend-terrific-test-ew9y2dg1q.vercel.app
user: emailfortest@gmail.com
pass: 1234556

If you wanna install the project and use it, feel free to do it. You need to clone this repository and run the backend with the command: node index.js

Thanks in advance,
Carlos
